## How to Use:
1. Download this Repository to your local coding environment and unzip it.
2. Replace the keys in the .env with your own API keys using the links below.
3. Install the required Python libraries in the requirements.txt file [pip install -r requirements.txt].
4. Run system.py to see city scores. Feel free to add new cities to see their transportation scores!

## üåü Inspiration
I was inspired by the need to tackle the challenges cities face with climate change and transportation. As more people rely on cars and other motorized transport, pollution and congestion have become serious issues. I'm also someone who really enjoys being outside and traveling by way of bike and skateboard so I wanted to create something that could help determine how good cities are for particular non-motorized modes. This package is designed to give cities a way to evaluate how well they‚Äôre doing with walking, cycling, and public transport, and to guide urban planning toward greener, more sustainable choices.

## üöÄ Overview
ASPIRE is a tool designed to assess transportation options in urban neighborhoods across the U.S. At its core, ASPIRE takes a neighborhood name as input and gathers a wide range of data, including location details, geographical maps, and weather information. This data is then fed into three machine learning models that have been trained on data from 100 neighborhoods in major American cities. Each model is specialized to evaluate a specific mode of transportation‚Äîwalking, biking, or public transport‚Äîresulting in scores that indicate how viable each option is in that neighborhood.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Features
- Multi-Mode Transportation Scoring: Provides separate scores for walkability, bikeability, and public transport viability for any U.S. neighborhood.
- Automated Data Collection: Gathers and processes location, geographical, and weather data automatically, requiring minimal user input.
- Data-Driven Insights: Uses machine learning models trained on data from 100 U.S. neighborhoods to deliver accurate, reliable transportation viability scores.
